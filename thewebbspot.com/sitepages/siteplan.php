                    <h2>Purpose</h2>
                    <p>
                        When you think of a spot, you think of somewhere. Think about 
                        finding your own spot on the world wide web, and what you 
                        could do. Everyone wants one spot where they can locate all 
                        their information, and that’s the exact purpose of the 
                        thewebbspot.com. Originally created as a web page for members 
                        of the Webb family, finding your own spot, has never been so 
                        much fun. Find a spot where you can post, share, comment, 
                        create. My purpose is to simply, elegantly, and professionally 
                        create a spot, where all information that is linked to my 
                        family can be viewed, stored, and remembered. It is a Webb 
                        of memories, thoughts, and ideas: all together in one spot.

                        Navigation, will simply be a simpler type of web-page. 
                        It will be a hierarchal website. You will navigate 
                        to each web-site and when you click over the section you 
                        want, it will automatically switch down a next section of 
                        possible selections. Fallback (create individual links 
                        if this feature is not supported). The simplicity of this 
                        web-site is to be able to navigate easily. You should be able to 
                        simply click and find which information you want on the site.
                        <br>
                        The site will be set up with links that are buttons that will allow 
                        navigation.
